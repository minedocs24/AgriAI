# ADR-001: Code Quality Standards Implementation

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-01-03

## Context
The AgriAI project requires a comprehensive code quality system to ensure maintainability, reliability, and consistent development practices across the team. As the codebase grows and more developers join, we need automated quality gates and standardized processes.

## Decision
We will implement a multi-layered code quality system with the following components:

### 1. Static Code Analysis
- **ESLint** with strict TypeScript rules
- **Prettier** for consistent code formatting
- **TypeScript strict mode** with comprehensive type checking
- **Security linting** for vulnerability detection

### 2. Testing Standards
- **Minimum 90% code coverage** for unit tests
- **Minimum 80% code coverage** for integration tests
- **Stricter coverage (95%)** for critical components (services, controllers, middleware)
- **Jest** as primary testing framework with comprehensive reporting

### 3. Pre-commit Quality Gates
- **Husky** for Git hooks
- **lint-staged** for selective file processing
- **Conventional commits** for commit message standardization
- **Type checking** before every commit

### 4. CI/CD Quality Pipeline
- **Multi-stage quality checks** in GitHub Actions
- **Parallel execution** for faster feedback
- **Security scanning** with CodeQL
- **Dependency vulnerability auditing**
- **Build verification** and artifact generation

### 5. Code Review Process
- **Mandatory 2 approvals** for all PRs
- **CODEOWNERS** for automatic reviewer assignment
- **PR templates** with comprehensive checklists
- **Branch protection** with required status checks

## Quality Thresholds

### Coverage Requirements
```javascript
global: {
  branches: 80,
  functions: 90, 
  lines: 90,
  statements: 90
}

critical_components: {
  branches: 90,
  functions: 95,
  lines: 95, 
  statements: 95
}
```

### Linting Rules
- No `any` types (strict TypeScript)
- No unused variables/imports
- Consistent naming conventions
- Complexity limits (max 10 for functions)
- JSDoc required for public APIs
- Security rules (no eval, script injection prevention)

### Performance Standards
- Build time < 5 minutes
- Test execution < 10 minutes
- Bundle size monitoring
- No regression in core metrics

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
- [x] ESLint strict configuration
- [x] Jest with coverage thresholds
- [x] Prettier setup
- [x] Basic CI/CD pipeline

### Phase 2: Integration (Week 2)
- [x] Husky pre-commit hooks
- [x] GitHub Actions workflows
- [x] Branch protection rules
- [x] PR templates and CODEOWNERS

### Phase 3: Enhancement (Week 3)
- [x] OpenAPI documentation
- [x] Security scanning integration
- [x] Performance monitoring
- [x] Quality metrics dashboard

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Higher code quality** and consistency
- **Reduced bugs** through comprehensive testing
- **Faster onboarding** with clear standards
- **Automated quality enforcement** reducing manual review time
- **Better documentation** with OpenAPI specs
- **Security by default** with automated scanning

### Negative
- **Initial setup complexity** and learning curve
- **Slower development** in short term due to quality gates
- **Additional dependencies** and maintenance overhead
- **Potential CI/CD bottlenecks** during peak development

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Gradual rollout** with team training
- **Parallel CI execution** for performance
- **Clear documentation** and examples
- **Regular review** and optimization of rules
- **Quality gate bypass** for emergency fixes (with approval)

## Tools and Technologies

### Core Tools
- **ESLint 9.x** with TypeScript support
- **Prettier 3.x** for code formatting
- **Jest 29.x** with ts-jest
- **Husky 8.x** for Git hooks
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD

### Additional Tools
- **Codecov** for coverage reporting
- **CodeQL** for security analysis
- **Commitlint** for commit message validation
- **lint-staged** for incremental checks

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Key Metrics
- Code coverage percentage
- Build success rate
- Average PR review time
- Security vulnerability count
- Test execution time
- Bundle size trends

### Quality Dashboard
- Real-time quality metrics
- Trend analysis
- Team performance indicators
- Technical debt tracking

## Review and Updates
This ADR will be reviewed quarterly and updated as needed based on:
- Team feedback and pain points
- New tooling and best practices
- Project growth and complexity changes
- Industry standard evolution
